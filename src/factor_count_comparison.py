"""
Factor count comparison plots.

Reads the GCR resilience evidence ledger and produces, for several GCR scopes,
a stacked bar chart of the five countries with the most resilience factors.

For every scope (all GCR pooled, then ASRS / GCIL / GCBR individually) the chart
shows, per country:
    * resilience factors above the x-axis (split into named vs. inferred)
    * vulnerability factors below the x-axis (split into named vs. inferred)

Some ledger rows refer to regions rather than single countries. Those rows are
expanded onto every constituent country listed in ``REGION_TO_COUNTRIES`` so the
region's factor is counted for each of its members. Regions with no constituent
country in the ledger (or vague climatic regions) simply contribute nothing to
the country-level counts.

Output: one PNG per scope in ``results/figures/``.
